# hello-world
This repository is being used to complete assignment #1 on canvas.
As I mentioned at the start of the recording, my name is Justin Ramirez. I was born on October 16th, 2003, meaning I will be turning 21 in the following month. I am looking forward to what this class has to offer. On top of being a Computer Science major, I am also a psychology minor. I don't know what else to say so I will be ending it off there.
